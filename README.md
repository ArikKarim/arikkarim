## ‼️ About Me
I'm a student @ George Washington University's Elliott School of International Affairs. When I'm not busy studying international economic policy or conducting public policy research, you can find me speedcubing, practicing cardistry, and studying Japanese while sipping on an iced matcha latte! Learn more about me on my personal website: https://arikkarim.com/
